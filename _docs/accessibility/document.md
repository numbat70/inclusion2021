## PDF are not recommended

We generally recommend avoiding publishing PDFs and other documents online wherever possible. It’s usually more effective and accessible to repurpose the same content into a HTML webpage.  

**The problems with PDF**
- They do not change size to fit the browser
- They’re not designed for reading on screens
- It’s harder to track their use
- They cause difficulties for navigation and orientation
- They can be hard for some users to access
- They’re less likely to be kept up to date
- They’re hard to reuse

However, there may be situations where we can’t avoid publishing a document online or sharing it directly with a customer – for example, when sending funding applicants an offer letter or contract. We also regularly share documents with colleagues to share information or collaborate. It’s important that all our documents are accessible, whether they're being shared internally or externally.  

> Whenever you prepare a document, you should assume that some people reading it might:  
> - Not see colours or not see them well   
> - Need to magnify the document  
> - Be using a screen reader   
> - Have low literacy or speak English as a second language 
> - Find it difficult to read or understand large amounts of text

## Tips to make your documents accessible  

### Language and content 

**Write in clear, simple English with no jargon**. Make sure you explain any acronyms or technical terms you use for those who might not be familiar with them – for example, customers, colleagues outside your team, or new starts. There are tools to check the level of readability of your text like [the Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) 

**Avoid writing in block capitals**. These are harder to read for people with low vision or dyslexia and might be read letter by letter when soemone use a screen reader.

**Make sure your content is left aligned**. Avoid justifying your text as this can cause irregular spacing which can be confusing for some users.

### Headings and structure 

Structure the document logically and use headings to break it into meaningful sections. Your headings should be simple and descriptive – avoid ‘clever’ headings and puns.  

Headings should also be properly marked as headings – don’t just use large or bold font to signify a heading. This helps screen readers navigate the document. In Microsoft Word, heading styling can be found in ‘Styles’ under the ‘Home’ tab.

### Colours and contrast 

Avoid using colour alone to signify meaning.  

Make sure the text colour you’re using has a high contrast with the background of the document. Tools such as ['Accessible colors'](https://accessible-colors.com/) can help you check.

[**Back to top**]()

### Alternative (alt) text 

If you’re using images in your document that contain important meaning, information or text, make sure you add alt text. This is basically a short written description of the image. This means users who can’t see the image won’t miss out on important information.  

You don’t need to add alt text to decorative images.

### Links 

Make sure you add links as a hyperlink to text within your document. This ‘anchor text’ should give the link context to help the user understand where it’s going – never use ‘click here’.  

#### Example

**Do this**: You’ll find more information about this in our [business guides section](https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/learning-zone/business-guides).  

**Instead of**: You’ll find more information about this here: [https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/learning-zone/business-guides/](https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/learning-zone/business-guides)

### Checking a Word document for accessibility   

The Microsoft word toolbar with the Check Accessibility functionality highlighted in red.Microsoft Word has a built-in accessibility checker. Go to the review tab and click **‘Check accessibility’**. This will highlight errors such as missing alt text or low contrast text and help you fix them. 

![screenshot of the part of the menu where you can find the check accessiblity menu](/inclusion/accessibility/files/access-check-word.png)

### Checking a PDF for accessibility  

If you’re using Adobe Reader, go to Edit -> Accessibility -> Quick check. This will flag up any issues. To fix them, you need to edit the original document in Word or Adobe Acrobat Pro.   

> You can also ask the digital team to help.

### Using tables 

If you’re using tables, try to keep them simple and avoid merged or split cells.

### Graphs and charts 

If you’re sharing graphs and charts, try to provide a written version of the same information as well. This could be in a table or as written descriptions.

### Making complex documents accessible  

It’s likely that you’ll sometimes need to create more complex documents than a Word document or PDF. As much as possible, follow the same accessibility guidelines – use simple language, mark headings properly, use good colour contrast and add alt text.  

[**Back to top**]()
 
### Simplifying a complex document  

We all process and understand information in different ways, and it’s fine to use whatever tools you need to help you work best – for some people this might be visual tools like a flowchart or an online whiteboard tool. However, if you need to share some of this information, consider whether you can simplify it into a more accessible version to share instead of or alongside the visual information.  

A simple flowchart could be written out in steps. An organisation chart can be broken down using bullets and sub bullets. All the notes and comments left in an interactive space could be summarised in a word document or simple table.

## Try a screen reader for yourself   

To test how your documents would work with a screen reader, you can download one yourself and try it out. We’d recommend [Non-Visual Desktop Access (NVDA)](https://www.nvaccess.org/).

## Media files

You need to provide an alternative for people who can’t hear or see.

Videos with audio require captions synchronised with the audio track. Everything said in the video should be included in the captions. It should  include names, sounds and descriptions.

**2 types of captions:**

- **Open caption**: is embedded into the video itself, and cannot be turned off
- **Closed captioning**: can be turned on and off

**Auto-generated captions** are better than nothing but usually not great: Often inaccurate, especially if the speaker has an accent or when captioning names (people, brand, places etc…)

This will also be used by many people who are not native speakers, or are in a noisy environment or don’t want others to hear what they are watching for example.

Ideally, **provide a transcript** of your media, so people can either read it or use a screen reader to hear it. 

- allow people to scan the content and see if they want to engage with it 
- can be searched by people and search engines so better for SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)


**Audio descriptions** speak out what is happening in the video so that it’s accessible to people with low vision. There are two ways to create audio descriptions:

1. a narrator describes all the visual information
2. add a separate audio track that describes the visual information
