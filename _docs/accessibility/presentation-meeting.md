It’s important to make sure your presentations, meetings, webinars and events are accessible, especially as more and more of these take place in a virtual environment. This is important both for internal meetings and presentations, as well as webinars, workshops and events with customers. 

> Remember that some of your audience: 
> 
> - May not be able to see all or parts of the presentation  
> - Might struggle to understand parts of the presentation 
> - May not be able to hear the speakers  
> - May speak English as a second language 
> - May be using assistive technology

<p><strong>Ask your participants what they need</strong></p>
<p> When organising an event, presentation, webinar or meeting, it’s good practise to offer your participants an opportunity to let you know how you can make the session more accessible to them.</p>
 <p>You could provide contact details to get in touch with you, or build it into the booking process – similar to how many booking services let participants add dietary requirements. You could also allow users to respond anonymously to an online survey.</p>

## Before the event

- Give an agenda, explain the goal of this event, who will be attending and the expectations from the participants
- When the event lasts more than an hour, plan for a break and announce ahead
- Ask if anyone as some special requirements, anything they might need to know before the event that is not mentioned in the agenda
- Make sure the language used in the invitation is inclusive and make people feel safe to share anything thye might request from you
- If online and using some specific tools, provide some guidance or tutorials for people who might not be familiar with them

> **Always ask your participants what they need**. You can't plan for anything. Give them the opportunity to tell you. 

### Share materials ahead of the session 

Sending the presentation and any other relevant materials to your audience before the session starts means your participants can view the presentation on their own device if they need to. People with low vision can zoom in and resize their own version of the presentation, and people with technology restrictions who can’t see your shared screen can follow along from their own device.   

It can also help give people with cognitive disabilities more time to read through and familiarise themselves with the content of the presentation.  

## During the event

### Record the session 

This isn’t just helpful for people who couldn’t attend the live session. It also means participants can re-watch the session if there was something they missed or didn’t understand.  

### Add captions and transcripts 

Using live captions or BSL interpreters means more users can join in the live session – which is important if there’s interactive elements or opportunities to ask questions. If this isn’t possible, you should always at least add captions to the recording of the session. Creating a transcript of the session can also be useful.  
 
### Learn how to use your tools well 

Many virtual tools come with built-in accessibility tools. For example, many meeting tools allow you to ‘pin’ a user to the screen, meaning that they’ll always be visible. This is particularly useful for users who always need to see a BSL interpreter, or need to be able to lip read during the presentation.  

Get to know the tools you’re using to find the best ways to make them accessible, and to help your audience or participants to use them in a way that helps them. 

For internal communication we use **Microsoft Teams**. They’ve provided a list of Teams accessibility features that you can get to know to make your meetings more inclusive.

## The presentation 

A presentation is usually involved in some form during most meetings, virtual events and physical events. How you deliver the presentation is important, but so is the formatting of the presentation itself.  

### Use large font sizes 

Presentations are often smaller when you share your screen than they would be on your own screen, and some people may be watching on a smaller screen than you. Consider this when choosing your font size.   

> We suggest a minimum font size of 36.  

### Reduce the amount of text 

It’s tempting to overload your slides with information, but it’s often counter-productive. Participants may feel overwhelmed with the amount of text or may struggle to read it and listen to the presentation at the same time. It also often forces you to use a smaller font.  

Instead, keep the text on slides to a minimum, or consider splitting text across more than one slide.  

### Colours and contrasts 

Make sure the text colour you’re using contrasts well with the background of your presentation. Tools such as Tanaguru contrast finder can help you check. 

### During the presentation 

#### Describe visual content  

Remember that not everyone can see what you’re seeing. Describe what’s on the slide, including any graphs or images. 

If your participants are using video, it’s also good to describe any reactions that you see. For example, “I can see Joe is shaking his head” or “I can see most of you are nodding your heads”. 

If an audience member asks a question in the chat, make sure to read out the question before you answer.  

#### Use good lighting  

Make sure you’re presenting in a well-lit room so that participants who need to lip read can see you clearly.  

#### Speak slowly and clearly 

> Use a mic! Even if you have a loud voice. Make sure people hear you.

Your audience may include people with hearing impairments or cognitive impairments, or people who speak English as a second language. Make sure to speak slowly and clearly so that people can hear what you’re saying and have time to process it.  

It’s also a good idea to pause in between slides. This lets your audience process what you’ve just said and read what’s on the next slide.  

#### Plan breaks 

If your session is longer than an hour, you should factor in short breaks. As well as providing a chance for participants to take a bathroom break, get a drink or even just move about, it also reduces cognitive load for users who may feel overwhelmed. It gives a chance to process the information that’s been shared and finish taking notes.  

#### Managing questions and participation  

Make sure that all participants are muted while someone is speaking to reduce background noise.  

Don’t pressure users to turn their cameras on or ask questions out loud. Always give the opportunity to ask questions or share ideas via a chat feature or interactive tools like Slido.    

> In collaborative sessions and meetings, it’s likely that participants will ask questions or share updates, opinions or information out loud. Depending on the nature of the session, you may want to introduce formal ways of requesting to speak, for example entering a question in the chat, or using a ‘raise hand’ feature.  
> 
> **Make sure each participant has a way to take part to the discussion and ask questions whatever their abilities**
 

## Making physical events accessible  

If you’re running a physical event or workshop, you should still follow any applicable guidelines on this page. If you’re using a presentation, make sure it uses a large font and isn’t over-crowded with text. Speak clearly, describe visual elements out loud and plan plenty of breaks. However, there are a few additional considerations you’ll need to remember when hosting a physical event.  

### Physical access 

When you host an event in a physical location rather than a virtual space, there are additional access requirements you need to consider. While you’re unlikely to find a venue that can provide everything, here’s a list of things that will make your venue accessible: 

- Lift and ramp access – not just to the building, but to each floor and room  
- Lift buttons that can be accessed by someone using a wheelchair  
- Automatic doors or doors that can be opened with a button  
- Disabled toilets and gender-neutral toilets  
- Disabled parking and non-disabled parking – ideally these should be free 
- Nearby access to public transport 
- A quiet room
- A nursing room and changing facilities for parents with babies   
- Wide corridors and large rooms that allow users with mobility devices and service animals to move around easily 

> **[Euan's guide can help you find an accessible venue](https://www.euansguide.com/)**

### Communicate accessibility to your audience 

Your event page should contain details about how accessible the event is. Make sure these are clear and honest – if there’s a ramp into the building but no lift to the venue room, make sure people are aware of this.   

There may also be other information that people might want to know about your venue. Some people with cognitive disabilities or anxiety may want to know, in detail, exactly how to enter your building and where to go or what to do once inside. Pictures can help to show what attendees should be looking for.  

It’s also good to let people know if food and drink is allowed in the venue, and what facilities – like shops or food outlets – are nearby.  

> When something is not available (no disabled toilets for example) do tell your participants ahead. They might still be able to attend and make their own arrangement. 

### Recording, captions and translators 

Try to record as much of the event as possible, especially key parts like speakers. Make sure to provide captions and ideally a transcript before sharing the recordings. 

If possible, try to provide a live captioning service or BSL interpreter on the day of the event. This means more people can get involved on the day instead of having to catch up afterwards.  

## After the event

Ask for honest feedback. What worked well and what didn't. That way you can improve the next event.
