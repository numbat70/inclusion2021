## Neurodiversity

Neurodiversity is an umbrella term that describes a wide range of conditions affecting how the brain works. Neurodiverse conditions can be complex, usually occur along a spectrum, and can interlink. Examples of neurodiversity include autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia and Tourette syndrome.  

Neurodiverse people may experience a range of cognitive impairments, including: 
- Not understanding or processing information the same way you do 
- Memory loss – for example, struggling to remember information they’ve just been given 
- Difficulty reading and understanding written language 
- Losing attention easily 
- Feeling overwhelmed by large amounts of information  
- Struggling with complex problem solving or decision making 

However, anyone can experience cognitive impairments – for example, as a result of ageing, injury or illness.  

> Good steps to take to make sure your site or service is accessible to a wide range of neurodiverse users and users with cognitive impairments include: 
> - Writing in plain English – use simple language, avoid jargon and explain complicated terms  
> - Making sure your site is compatible with screen readers [see the section on Blindness for more information](#blindness-and-visual-impairments)   
> - Providing alternative versions of content – for example in a video version or an easy-read version 
> - Using pictures to support your content 
> - Avoiding large blocks of text – break up content with headings and use formatting like bullets to make it easier to digest 
> - Keeping your page layout simple and consistent 
> - Using contrasting colours, but avoiding anything too bright and overwhelming  

Talk from [**Rachel Morgan-Trimmer**](https://sparkleclass.com/)'s Workshop: What is neurodiversity and why should you care about it?
<iframe title="Workshop: What is neurodiversity and why should you care about it?" width="624" height="468" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdrbrHVD11I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Simple tips

**1. Tell people what to expect**
Whether it’s a meeting, an event, a webinar or an application on a website: Tell them when it will start, if there will be a break, how long it will last, who will take part, what is expected of them.

Provide some practical information: are toilets available? is there a quiet room, any documents they might need to bring for example.

**2. Remember that they don’t have your knowledge**
They might:
- not see things the way you do
- understand some terms differently
- not understand your jargon

Be clear, use plain English, explain acronyms and terms, make sure people know they can ask if they don’t understand a term.

**3. Use pictures**
Use images to support your text.

For example, add a photo of your building entrance on your website so when people come and visit for the first time, they recognise it and are confident this is the right place.

Good visuals will make your information more memorable, and will help support people’s attention.

**4. Use fewer words and use simple sentences and bullet points**
Only give people what is relevant to them at the right time.

Dont create a wall of text.

**5. Have a clear presentation**
- align text to the left
- don’t justify your text
- be consistent
- do not underline words (underline is for links)
- don’t write in all caps, it’s harder to read as you lose the shape of the word (unless it’s an acronym or something people are used to, like GOV.UK, or ADHD for example)
- use good contrast but not too bright
- use simple colours
- leave enough space between lines

**6. Listen properly**
Sometime, neurodiverse people don’t speak with enough intention so you might not realise something they told you is really important to them. So listen carefully.

**7. People might not know what they need**
By asking them what they need (sitting at the front or at the back, having a break now or later etc…) you force them to actually think about what they need and to communicate it to you.

**8. Remember that how you create your information is not necessarely how it will be received**
People might be distracted, doing something else or not understand it the way you intented to.

**9. People might be hiding their condition or needs**
… and be very good at it as they have done it for years!

**10. Do nothing**
Neurodiverse people are often seen as a challenge or a problem, but treating them normally makes them feel included.

### Autism

Autism is a spectrum condition and affects everyone differently. There are differences in communication, sensory processing, social understanding and how you process information. Women are often diagnosed very late as there are still a lot of misconceptions about what autism is.

### ADHD (Attention Decificit Hyperactivity Disorder)

The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be categorised into 2 types of behavioural problems: inattentiveness, and hyperactivity and impulsiveness.

Most people with ADHD have problems that fall into both these categories, but this is not always the case.

For example, some people with the condition may have problems with inattentiveness, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness.

This form of ADHD is also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD can sometimes go unnoticed because the symptoms may be less obvious. (Source [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/symptoms/))

**Women are often under diagnosed** as their symptoms are not always as obvious because they have learned to mask them.

Despite the name, ADHD doesn’t exactly result in a “deficit” of attention, but more an issue regulating it, making it harder to plan, prioritise, avoid impulses, remember things and focus.

From this Guardian article [The lost girls: ‘Chaotic and curious, women with ADHD all have missed red flags that haunt us’](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/02/the-lost-girls-chaotic-and-curious-women-with-adhd-all-have-missed-red-flags-that-haunt-us):

> "On a good day, it’s like watching a train whizz past you while you’re trying to read the text on the side and make out faces in the windows."
> 
> "On a bad, a bird might land in front of you. Curious, you pull out your phone, Google the bird and get stuck in a “pigeons of the world” vortex. You discover cassowary eggs are bright green and in 2005, UK police found a leg of swan in the Queen’s Master of Music’s freezer. Two terrine recipes later, the train has long passed and night has fallen. Dazed, you sink under a dark cloud of self-loathing, lamenting another lost day. You don’t remember what kind of bird it was." - Noelle Faulkner

This talk about ADHD in women could be of interest. A word of caution: In it, Rachel mentions that vitamin B6 helps her. You should talk to your GP first before doing the same, as taking too much can be bad for you.

### Dyspraxia

Dyspraxia, also known as developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD), is a common disorder that affects movement and co-ordination.

Dyspraxia does not affect your intelligence. It can affect your co-ordination skills – such as tasks requiring balance, playing sports or learning to drive a car. Dyspraxia can also affect your fine motor skills, such as writing or using small objects. (Source: [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-coordination-disorder-dyspraxia-in-adults/))

There is a disconnect between your brain and your body. 
Giving specific sequences and steps for task to follow can help.

> Some personal takes on this from [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sacha_coward/status/1301516498226343942?s=20) by Sacha Coward:
> "I was always clumsy, but it went further than that; I couldn't tie my shoes till I was 13, or put months in order, or tell the time from an analogue clock. Something about my brain always struggled with sequences, fine motor skills and choreography."
>
> "The clumsiness is the most common thing people picture when they hear 'dyspraxia', but it also (for me at least) includes difficulties in memory of lists, in knowing the way a shape/letter should face, and an excessive or weak grip (I'm as likely to drop a glass as smash it!)"

A good article to understand how living with dyspraxia can be: [A Disability That Does Not Count](https://humanparts.medium.com/a-disability-that-does-not-count-656b5e95e6c1) by Ronan J. O'Shea

### Face blindness

Prosopagnosia – or face blindness – could affect as many as 2% of the UK population, and its symptoms can even lead to it being mistaken for autism.

## Blindness and visual impairments

### Blindness

There are varying degrees of blindness and the legal definition can vary from country to country. Some legally blind people may still be able to distinguish light from dark and may still have some vision.  

> These users typically use screen readers or Braille display. Things to consider for users with varying degrees of blindness include: 
> - Making sure your content uses correct heading hierarchy and nesting structure (H1, H2, H3 and so on) 
> - Adding alt text to mages that convey information (rather than being decorative)  
> - Producing audio content to support written content where possible  
> - Making sure all interactive elements of your page can be accessed with a keyboard  
> - Making sure headings, links and buttons are descriptive  
> - Avoid using directional language like ‘the navigation on the left side of the page’

### Partially sighted

This covers a wide range of sight issues, from extreme long or short sightedness, to partial blindness, clouded vision or a small field of vision.  

>These users may use a screen reader or Braille display (see advice under ‘Blindness’). They may also adjust elements of visual sites to make them easier to read. They can get lost in a page. Things to consider for partially sighted users include: 
> - Allowing users to resize text without distorting the page 
> - Allowing users to zoom in and out 
> - Allowing users to scroll horizontally as well as vertically  
> - Making sure your site is compatible with screen readers 
> - Publish all information as responsive HTML web pages – not PDFs 
> - Use good colour contrasts  
> - Use a readable font size

### Colour blindness

Some people with colour blindness won’t find any effect on their ability to use websites. It's sometimes called being "colour blind", although total colour blindness (an inability to see any colour) is very rare. Some may struggle to read text or see images if contrast is not high enough. And some may use additional software like Color Enhancer to change the colours on a site.  

There are various types:
-	Deuteranomaly: reduce sensitivity to green
-	Protanopia: reduce sensitivity to red
-	Tritanopia: reduce sensitivity to blue


> Things to consider for colour-blind users include: 
> - Making sure all text, buttons and other elements use strong colour contrast 
> - Avoiding relying on colour alone to convey meaning 

[**Back to top**]()

## Deaf and hearing impairments

Just like blindness, deafness comes in varying degrees, and people who are legally Deaf may still have some hearing. Many deaf people use British Sign Language (BSL) as their primary language. This means they may struggle to read and understand written text or video captions as English is technically their second language.  

> Things to consider for deaf users include: 
> - Adding captions and transcripts to video content 
> - Creating BSL versions of content where possible  
> - Including a BSL interpreter at events  
> - Make sure written content is written in plain English 
> - Break up content using headings, bullet points and images

## Motricity impairments

Users with physical or motor disabilities may only be able to move some parts of their body, or may experience tremors or difficulty with co-ordination. 

Some people might use a switch, a mouth-head stick keyboard, trackball mouse, keyboard only or an assistive Joystick. They can use voice activated software instead of typing. Some special keyboards can help you type.
All these assistive technologies can be expensive and create extra issues when used with other devices potentially

>Things to consider users with physical or motor disabilities include: 
> - Making sure actionable elements (like buttons, links, fields and dropdowns) are large enough to be easily selected, and far enough away from other actionable elements that users won’t select the wrong one by accident  
> - Making sure all actionable elements can be accessed by a keyboard 
> - Making sure it’s clear which element is in focus when using a keyboard or assistive technology  
> - Avoid device-specific language like ‘click’ or ‘tap’ – use something more general like ‘select’ or ‘choose’

## Cognitive impairments

There is a wide range of issues, some mild, some more severe, some can be punctual, and others permanent.

Dyslexia, autism, anxiety, dementia, Alzheimer, dyscalculia and dyspraxia for example.

This can affect the way you process information, your memory, your comprehension, your attention and the way you make decisions.

### Makaton

Makaton is a language programme that uses symbols, signs and speech to enable people to communicate. It supports the development of essential communication skills such as attention and listening, comprehension, memory, recall and organisation of language and expression.

In addition to children and adults with communication and learning difficulties and the community around them – for example, teachers, health professionals, friends, public service bodies etc. Makaton is increasingly used by the general public to aid communication.

## Invisible disabilities

When you hear 'disability' you usually think: Wheelchair. But In the UK, 93–95% of people with disabilities are not wheelchair users.

![a cross and the wheelchair symbol visual with the message: 93% of people with disabilities don't use a wheelchair](/images/a11y/93visability.png)

From [Visability93](https://www.visability93.com/)

### What is an invisible disability?
The [Invisible Disabilities Association](https://invisibledisabilities.org/what-is-an-invisible-disability/) says:

> An invisible disability is a physical, mental or neurological condition that is not visible from the outside, yet can limit or challenge a person’s movements, senses, or activities.

Symptoms can be debilitating pain, fatigue, dizziness, cognitive dysfunctions, learning differences, mental health disorders, or hearing and vision impairments for example. They can limits your daily activities.

These can come from a wide range of conditions like Fibromyalgia, Crohn’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis (M.S.), Autism, Anxiety, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E. also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), Lupus, and many more…

![various symbols illustrating different disabilities like bipolar, Crohn's, fibromyalgia](/images/a11y/other-symbols.png)

People with invisible disabilities regularly face problems in public places and at work because others don't realise there are some things they can't do.

### The spoon theory
When you live with a chronic disease, your energy is limited. You will have bad days and good days. You need to pace yourself and plan ahead what you will be able to do that day. The [Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) was created by Christine Miserandino to explain to a friend how it felt to live with Lupus, making one spoon an energy unit: If you are healthy, you start your day with an unlimited number of spoons, but if you're not, you might start your day with 15 spoons on a 'good day'. Every thing you do will take away some spoons, and when they are gone, you can't do anyhting until the next day. 

This video explains this quite well.
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFY81e396ag" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<blockquote class="info"><p><strong>The take away</strong>: don't assume someone can do something because they have done it the day before, they might be low on spoons...</p> </blockquote>

### Public places: Priority seats in transports, accessible toilets and disabled parking spaces

It’s easy to find articles about people with invisible disabilities being treated badly by the public assuming they are abusing the system.
> _“I have been verbally abused on public transport because I have a white cane & use my phone. I have residual vision like 94% of registered blind people. I use accessible tech to magnify the screen.#BlindPeopleUsePhone”_ — [Dr Amy Kavanagh](https://twitter.com/BlondeHistorian/status/1189790200404348928)

### Some initiatives are trying to help

#### Blue badge
The [Blue Badge scheme has been extended](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/people-with-hidden-disabilities-to-benefit-from-blue-badges) to hidden disabilities, including autism and mental health conditions.

#### In the transports
For example, [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/transport-accessibility/please-offer-me-a-seat) created a badge and a card stating “Please offer me a seat”. You don’t have to prove you need it. It can empower some people to ask for a seat and if you’re lucky, someone might notice it and you might not even have to ask. But a lot of people using it seem to still feel judged or get weird looks.

> “I’ve only used it a few times, when I have, I can just feel people staring at me, I’ve never used it when the trains have been particularly busy so couldn’t say whether it actually works or not, but I’ve never felt more judged.” — Caitlin

From the website "[you look ok to me"](https://www.youlookokaytome.com/)

‘Happy to move for you’ is the [same idea but for people who are happy to offer their seat](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/happy-to-move-for-you-tube-badge-for-people-with-hidden-illnesses-to-be-rolled-out-across-uk-a4276381.html) to someone who might need it. Ellie Kime came up with this badge:

#### Toilets access
[Crohn’s & Colitis UK](https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/news/not-every-disability-is-visible-campaign-targets-restaurants-and-pubs) has launched [Not Every Disability is Visible](https://www.noteverydisabilityisvisible.org.uk/about-the-campaign) inspired by campaigner Grace Warnock. They ask UK’s major supermarkets, restaurants, pubs and travel hubs to change their accessible toilet signs to highlight that Not Every Disability is Visible.

> “I’d rather be thought rude than detail to a colleague why I’m not folding chairs and stacking them against the wall at the end of the meeting.” — [Hope R. Henderson](https://themighty.com/2017/12/coming-out-as-a-person-with-an-invisible-disability/)

### Why people often do not want to disclose they have an invisible disability?
> “Knowing someone has a disability more often than not changes the way you perceive them. Whether the reaction is discriminatory or empathetic, this unwanted attention can make life feel suffocating. In being open about our disability, we unfortunately have to accept the reality that people will treat us differently.” — [Isabelle Jani-Friend](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/09/disabilities-invisible-prove-stangers-disabled-services-illnesses)

> “Most days, most places, I don’t want to tell. I don’t want to tell the driver or the scowling elderly passengers why I need a seat on the bus. I don’t want to explain that I’m not there to teach the yoga for disabilities class.” From [Coming Out as a Person With an Invisible Disability – by Hope R. Henderson](https://themighty.com/2017/12/coming-out-as-a-person-with-an-invisible-disability/)
