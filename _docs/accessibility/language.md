# Language to use when talking about disabilities

## General guidance 

It’s usually best to just ask the person you’re speaking to how they’d prefer you to refer to their disability or accessibility needs. But it's not always possible when addressing a wider audience.

Here are some general best practise guidelines: 

- Avoid using terms like ‘disabled’ or ‘disabilities’ too generally – are you really referring to all people with any disability, or do you specifically mean wheelchair users, people with vision impairments, people with hearing loss or another more specific disability?  
- Avoid using negative terms like ‘suffers from’ or ‘confined to’ (in relation to a wheelchair) 
- When talking about people without disabilities, don’t use terms like ‘normal’ or ‘healthy’. Just say ‘people without disabilities’ 
- **Consider if you need to refer to a disability at all**. For example, when pointing users to a video transcript, you can just say ‘If you prefer, you can read a transcript of this video here’ rather than ‘If you’re deaf or hard of hearing, you can read a transcript of this video here’.  

 
## People first or identity first? 

**People-first language** means putting the person before their disability – for example, ‘people with disabilities’ or ‘someone with autism’ or ‘a person who is blind’.  

**Identity-first language** means putting how the person identifies first – for example ‘disabled people’ ‘an autistic person’ or ‘a blind person’. 

The preferred option in the UK seems to be identity first language. Many people in disabled communities feel this helps them ‘own’ their disabilities, to reduce stigma and promote pride. Of course, everyone has their own preferences, and some people do prefer person-first language. 

When writing or speaking for Scottish Enterprise or our partners, we recommend using identity first language where possible. There are some exceptions, which we’ll explore on this page.  

 

Neurodiversity (including Autism, ADHD and dyslexia) 

We recommend taking the 'identity first’ approach when talking about neurodiversity. However, there are some exceptions.  

The terms we recommend using are: 

An autistic person 

A dyslexic person 

Neurodiverse people  

A person with ADHD 

A person with dyspraxia  

You can also use the more general term, ‘neurodiverse people’, if you need to.  

 

Cognitive impairments 

There can be a lot of overlap between neurodiversity and cognitive impairments. We usually use ‘cognitive impairments’ to refer to specific impairments related to the brain – for example, memory loss, difficulty processing information, cognitive overload or difficulty understanding written language. Both neurodiverse and neurotypical people can experience cognitive impairments. This can be the result of a specific condition like Autism or ADHD, an injury or illness such as a stroke, or just related to ageing.   

We recommend saying ‘people with cognitive impairments’ as it’s simpler than ‘cognitively impaired people’.  

 

Sight conditions 

Sight conditions can vary greatly, from blindness or partial sight, to colour blindness. The definitions of these can vary too – some legally blind people still have some sight. We recommend using the following terms when talking about people with sight conditions: 

Blind people  

People with partial sight  

People with low vision  

People with colour blindness 

People with visual impairments  

Do not use terms like ‘the blind’ or ‘the visually impaired’.  

 

Hearing loss 

Just like sight conditions, hearing loss can vary from person to person. Some people may not be able to hear at all, while some may still have partial hearing in one or both ears. We recommend using the following terms when talking about people with sight conditions: 

Deaf people 

People with hearing loss  

People who are hard of hearing  

Don’t use terms like ‘the deaf’, unless you’re referring more generally to ‘the Deaf community’.  

 

Physical or motor disabilities 

This includes a range of disabilities and accessibility needs. We recommend using the following terms for people with physical or motor disabilities: 

Someone with a physical disability  

People with motor disabilities  

Wheelchair users 

People who experience tremors 

People who experience difficulty with co-ordination  

Where possible, try to refer to the specific condition or symptom you mean, because different types of physical and motor disabilities can result in different accessibility needs.  

 

Further reading 

GOV.UK has a useful list of words to use and words to avoid when talking about disabilities.  

If you’re looking for guidance around a specific disability, look for a local or national organisation that can help. The way they talk about disabilities on their own websites gives a good idea of what the best practise may be. Here are a list of sites that may be useful: 

Royal National Institute of Blind People 

Visibility Scotland 

Sight Scotland 

deafscotland 

Deaf action 

Disability information Scotland   

Inclusion Scotland 

British Dyslexia Association 

Scottish Autism
