> On Twitter, you can **follow disabled people and learn from them**. 
> Social Media don't have to keep you in your own little bubble, this can also be a way for you to learn from people very different from you. Give it a try!

To reach your audience, you need to do better to make sure everyone can access your posts on social media.

## Write clearly and use plain English 

Use plain English‚ÄØlike you would with any other content for our services.‚ÄØAvoid jargon and use clear, simple language.  

If you‚Äôre creating a longer post on platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn, you should use line breaks to break up your text.  

## Alt text
All pictures (including diagrams) should have an Alt text (alternative text)  so users with screen readers know what the image is and get the same level of information as users who can see the image.‚ÄØ

Here how to do this on:
- [Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/109799)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/214124458607871)

Not all platforms let you add alt text to a gif. If you can‚Äôt add proper alt text, just describe it within your post in [square brackets]

## Capitalise hashtags
Capitalising the first letter of each words on hashtags improves readability for people using screen readers.
For example: **#ThisIsHowtoFormatAnAccessibleHashtag**

> Did you know what **#a11y** means? 
>
> This is an abbreviation for Accessibility, it's called a numeronym, it's the first and last letters and there are 11 in between.

## Caption videos and multimedia

## Emoji
You can use emojis, but be aware that screen readers will describe them out loud. For example:‚ÄØüòÉ‚ÄØwould become ‚Äúsmiley face emoji‚Äù.‚ÄØThis means if you use an emoji in the middle of a sentence, it might make it more difficult for someone using a screen reader to follow the sentence.  

Emojis should only be used in addition to written text ‚Äì never replace a word in a sentence with an emoji.  

## Hashtags and mentions should go at the end
The symbols # and @ are said aloud by screen readers, and makes it harder to understand the sentence they are part of. Adding them after the text, will make it clearer.

## Avoid writing in capital letters
Some people rely on the ‚Äòshape‚Äô of a word to read more efficiently. Using all caps means words lose this shape, and in some cases may cause a screen reader to read the word letter by letter.
