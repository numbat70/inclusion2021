> **This is a great place to start!**

> On Twitter, you can **follow disabled people and learn from them**. 
> Social Media don't have to keep you in your own little bubble, this can also be a way for you to learn from people very different from you. Give it a try!

To reach your audience, you need to do better to make sure everyone can access your posts on social media. 


## Alt text
All pictures (including diagrams) should have an Alt text (alternative text) which will be read by a screen reader for users who can‚Äôt see them.

Here how to do this on:
- [Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/109799)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/214124458607871)

When **adding a GIF**, describe it [in square brackets]

## Capitalise Hashtags
Capitalising the first letter of each words on hashtags improves readability for people using screen readers.
For example: **#ThisIsHowtoFormatAnAccessibleHashtag**

> Did you know what **#a11y** means? 
> This is an abbreviation for Accessibility, it's called a numeronym, it's the first and last letters and there are 11 in between.

## Emoji
We should try not to use them too much. They are read aloud by screen readers. For example: üòÉ would become: ‚Äúsmiley face emoji‚Äù.

## Hashtags and mentions should go at the end
The symbols # and @ are said aloud by screen readers, and makes it harder to understand the sentence they are part of. Adding them after the text, will make it clearer.

## Avoid Caps letters
It‚Äôs harder for everyone to read. The ‚Äòshape‚Äô of a word help readers to identify it. The shape is lost with capitals. It can be misinterpreted by screen readers as well and might be read letter by letter.
