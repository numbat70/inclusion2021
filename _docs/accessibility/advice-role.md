## Organising an event

> Check the section [Presentations, meetings, events](/inclusion/accessibility/presentation-meeting)

<hr class="big">

## Designing a website

> This will be addressed on the website for the Scottish Enterprise - Design System guidance. The website is not ready yet but should be in Early 2021

<hr class="big">

## Testing a website

<blockquote class="info">
<p>Some simple tests you can do:</p>
  <ul>
<li>No mouse, keyboard only, tabbing through - can you access every interactive component?  Does the order make sense? (use the Tab key to navigate, Shift+ Tab key to go back and the space bar or Enter to select something)</li>
<li>Set your screen to 400% zoom (in the settings or using Ctrl and +) - Can you still use your website or app?</li>
<li>Use on a small screen - can you still select a link, use all the components? Are tables, images and graphics still visible?</li>
  </ul>

This video of a talk by Alistair Duggin gives a really good view of all the aspects around testing for accessibility.
