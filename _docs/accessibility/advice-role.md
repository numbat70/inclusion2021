Depending on your role, there are some specific things you need to make sure you get right. This [guidance per job role from the DWP Accessibility manual](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/guidance-for-your-job-role) is good for reference.

## Creating content for others 

<blockquote class="red"><p>We will have a section about this in the SE Design System showcase website, but it's not ready yet</p></blockquote>

Have a look at the [Creating document](/inclusion/accessibility/document) section.

**When asked for large print**:

Don't just turn A4 document up onto A3 paper, when asked for accessible large print format. 

> A true large print document is freshly printed, in the font size and in the colour combination (print/paper colour) of the requester's choice, and is formatted correctly to look like the standard print document.

## Testing a website

Some simple tests you can do:
- No mouse, keyboard only, tabbing through - can you access everything? Does the order make sense? (use the Tab key to navigate, Shift+ Tab key to go back and the space bar or Enter to select something)
- set your screen to 400% zoom (in the settings or using Ctrl and +) - can you still use your website or app?
- Use on a small screen - can you still select a link, use all the components? are tables, images and graphics still visible?

For more information, you can check the [DWP guidance for QA testers](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/guidance-for-your-job-role/qa-tester)
