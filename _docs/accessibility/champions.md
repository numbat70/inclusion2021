## Joining the Accessibility Champions Network initiated by the BBC

The network is about peer support first. It will meet regularly, via a platform where everyone gets to network and chat in smaller groups.

We hope to learn from each other and that companies with similar challenges can provide each other with more contextual ideas and advice.

> This is a very new initiative and we will tell you more once it really get started.

Some advice from this video:
- Often people don't know what to do or how to do it well  
- Encourage volunteers, but don't volunteer them  
- Provide support and train volunteers  
- Provide guidelines, things to consider, tips, common pitfalls, have a wiki as a source of knowledge  
- Have a place to share ideas, ask for help (Yammer for example - we do have that)  
- Newsletter to communicate the rest of the company and get more volunteer potentially  
- Create a learner (future champion) pathway  
- Have this in your development objectives  
- Give talk across the business  
- Write guidance, case studies  
- Communicate the successes  
- Have a percentage of your work time allocated to this  
- Use your volunteer days to volunteer in associations that support people with disabilities
