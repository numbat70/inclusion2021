## Joining the Accessibility Champions Network initiated by the BBC

The network is about peer support first. It will meet regularly, via a platform where everyone gets to network and chat in smaller groups.

We hope to learn from each other and that companies with similar challenges can provide each other with more contextual ideas and advice.

> This is a very new initiative and we will tell you more once it really get started.

### Accessibility Champions, from zero to hero

### Some advice from this video:

Quite often people don't know what to do or how to do it well. We could provide guidelines, things to consider, tips, common pitfalls, have a wiki as a source of knowledge. This prototyped website is a potential way to do this.
We could also have a place to share ideas, and ask for help - Yammer - Slack or MS Teams?

We need volunteers, and encourage them (they should not be 'volunteered'). We need to support them and train them initially.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">We could:</p>
- have a learner (future champion) pathway  
- make this part of our development objectives  
- have a percentage of your work time allocated to this
- use our volunteer days in associations that support people with disabilities  

<p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Raise awareness and keep the focus</strong></p>
- give talk across the business  
- write guidance, case studies  
- communicate the successes
