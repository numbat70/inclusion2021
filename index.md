We are trying to do better about **Inclusion and Diversity** in Scottish Enterprise.
We are gathering guidelines and resources in one place to help you learn and improve.
> We are testing what type of information would be useful and in what format

There is a lot under the term 'diversity':

## Remote working as an opportunity
Interesting video about **remote working and the opportunity for Inclusion** is worth a watch

### User manual for me
This was addressed in the video above. This in an interesting concept. The idea is for an employee to give instructions about how best to interact with them.

For example:
- I prefer emails to calls or team messages
- I like to have some focus time in the morning, so prefer not to have meetings before 11am
- if you need something from me, be explicit about it as I don't always pick up light cues

Two articles about the concept and one blog post from the Digital Team:
